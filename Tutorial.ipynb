    "## Intro\n",
    "In this document we will go over the basics of Python programming necesseray to construct an ABAQUS python script. In order to effectively write ABAQUS scripts it is important to realize how Python itself works and how Python is implemented in ABAQUS.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Versions\n",
    "Python is a widely used programming language outside of ABAQUS. You may have heard of it's name here or there since it is an open source free software package anyone can download and install in their computers. A lot of the web and applications use Python as a language. ABAQUS many years ago, adopted Pythons as it's main scirpting language for all of it's software. It is important to note that as any open source language, Python has been evolving to different versions over time. As these versions evolve, free open source packages as well as the base syntax of Python has also evolved. The most current version of Python adopted by industry is version 3.6. ABAQUS scripting uses it's own proprietary installation of Python, and that installation up until ABAQUS 2018 version is still stuck at Python 2.7. To check the version of Python you're using you can simply type the following two lines on the Python prompt:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "sys.version\n",
    "```\n",
    "The output for ABAQUS 2017 yields the response\n",
    "```\n",
    "'2.7.3 (default, Feb  6 2016, 06:24:46) [MSC v.1700 64 bit (AMD64)]'\n",
    "```\n",
    "Which is far from the standard Python versions used in installations of Anaconda etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have covered some basic background, we will go over some useful commands that you can use in ABAQUS. We will focus on the syntax used for Python version 2.7 instead of Python 3.6 because that is what is used in ABAQUS."
